        intro:
            1: A Word War (or WW for short) is a session of limited time during which you set to write as much words as possible. It typically lasts 15 to 30 minutes tops.
            2: You can challenge either yourself or your friends and compare your word counts at the end. You just have to link your newly-created WW to your friends so that they can join you. <strong>Please note that they will need an account to participate.</strong>
